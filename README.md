# TDD Angular Workshop

When we learn a new technology unit testing come last. But what if it was the other way around?

Well, now you have the chance as I've already written the tests for you.

Uncomment the specs one by one and try to write the code to make them green.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies and `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

If you want to check your progress run `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
